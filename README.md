# Contact Managment App


This is a *Contact Manager App* built with Flutter. The app allows users to manage their contacts by adding, updating, and deleting contacts. It supports synchronization with Firebase for data backup and provides user authentication using Firebase Authentication. The app is backed by an SQL database (SQLite) that syncs with Firebase to ensure data consistency across multiple devices.

## Features

- *CRUD Operations*: Create, Read, Update, and Delete contacts locally.
- *SQL Database*: Uses SQLite for local data storage.
- *Firebase Sync*: Automatically syncs local data with Firebase.
- *Authentication*: Users can securely log in using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).
- *Data Backup*: Contacts are backed up to Firebase, allowing data retrieval on multiple devices.
- *User Interface*: Simple, clean, and user-friendly interface with Material Design.
- *Search Functionality*: Search contacts by name or other details.
- *Offline Support*: Access contacts offline, with sync enabled once the device is online.
